# MLX Audio Package (`mlx_audio/info.md`)

This directory contains the core Python package (`mlx_audio`) responsible for handling audio processing tasks using the MLX framework.

Based on the directory structure, it likely includes:

*   Implementations of various TTS models (Kokoro, Bark, etc.) adapted for MLX.
*   Audio codec models (Encodec, DAC, etc.).
*   Speech-to-speech transformation (STS) functionalities.
*   Utility functions for loading models, handling audio data, etc.
*   A potential server component (`server.py`) separate from the main Flask app.

This package is likely intended to be installable or used as a core library by applications like the Flask backend (`app.py`) in the parent directory.

*(This is a placeholder documentation file. Further details should be added based on the actual implementation within this package.)*
