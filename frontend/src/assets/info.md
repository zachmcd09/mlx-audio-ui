# Assets (`frontend/src/assets/info.md`)

This directory is intended to store static assets used by the frontend application, such as:

*   Images (e.g., logos, icons in formats like SVG, PNG, JPG)
*   Custom fonts
*   Other static files directly referenced by the components or CSS.

Currently, it contains the default React logo (`react.svg`) provided by Vite.
